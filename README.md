# Project Name

Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment
In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default

## General Information
The objective is to help identify applicants at risk of defaulting on loans, enabling a reduction in credit losses. 
This case study aims to achieve the goal through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the provided [dataset](./loan.csv)
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment

## Conclusions
- Applicants who use the loan to clear other debts, means purpose is debt consolidation
- Applicants having house ownership as RENT or Mortgage
- Applicants with employment length of 10+
- Implement strict verification criteria for grade B, C & D
- Evaluate the risk associated with 60-month loans with higher loan amount, as there is likelihood to defaults
- Ensure we are efficient scalable background check process during peak time of Q4
- Carefully evaluate all debt consolidation loans and keep release only low loan amount for shorter period of time
- Also take into account which state the loan application are coming from like CA & NY states have higher tendency to default 
- Review applications for borrower who high interest rate category with higher loan amount
